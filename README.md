# VulnX-CyberDefender
VulnX is a full-stack cybersecurity tool built to detect web vulnerabilities in real-time using live packet sniffing and manual scanning. It features a dynamic Flask-based dashboard with statistical graphs, PDF export, and optional Telegram bot alerts.

## Features

- 📡 **Live Packet Sniffing** (Scapy)
  - Detects suspicious payloads like XSS and SQLi in real-time.
  - Alerts shown instantly on the dashboard and/or via Telegram bot.

- **Manual Vulnerability Scanner**
  - Crawls a target website and tests for:
    - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
    - **SQL Injection**
  - Displays detailed scan results and saves them locally.

- **Cyberpunk-Style Dashboard**
  - View, filter, and refresh alerts.
  - Interactive graphs for alert statistics.
  - PDF export of both sniffer and scan results.

- **Offline Logging**
  - All alerts are stored in `alerts.json` and `scan_results.json`.

- **Telegram Bot Integration**
  - Get instant Telegram alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask, Scapy, Requests, FPDF, BeautifulSoup)
- HTML5 + CSS3 + Chart.js
- Telegram Bot API

## Getting Started

1)**Install dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

2)**Start Sniffer:**
sudo python3 sniffer.py

3)**Run Dashboard:**
python3 app.py

4)**Scan a Website**
Use the scan input field in the dashboard or run directly:
python3 scan.py

## Telegram Alert Setup:
1)Create a bot via @BotFather.
2)Replace TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in sniffer.py.

## Skipped: IP Blocking
We initially planned to add an IP blocking feature directly from the dashboard. However, to test this locally would mean self-blocking the host machine, thereby losing access to the dashboard. So this feature is documented but intentionally left out for safety.

## Future Enhancements
1)Real IP geolocation in alerts
2)Advanced vulnerability signatures
3)Remote deployment on cloud/VPS (e.g., Render, Heroku)
